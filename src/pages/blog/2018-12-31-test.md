  With a new year just starting I'm taking this opportunity to revive my
  personal site/blog and working towards one of my new year goals of doing it
  using a new tech stack.

The last time I had my own hand built site it was built on a LAMP stack with a  hand coded front end... how times have changed!  After recently suffering from tutorial fatigue I thought I'd try to get something up and running using JAMstack asap as a starting point so I went with using gatsbyJS and Netlify to host and provide the CMS.  

After some initial teething issues you are now looking at the starting point which is allowing me to set some initial goals for 2019

## Professional Goals 

\* Get started with JAMstack techniques for static and then dynamics sites

\* Get started with graphQL

\* Improve my dev workflow & tooling and look to moving towards TDD using Cypress.io

## Personal Goals

\* Start running again to improve my fitness (walking steps is no longer cutting it)

\* Lose some weight... currently 8kg heavier than I was 4 years ago so aim to lose somewhere in that region

## Home Goals

\* Adding a house extension 

\* Finish house redecoration

\* Rework my home office

We'll see how it goes!
