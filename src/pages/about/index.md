### Remote Working Web Developer

Working from home in the historic city of Canterbury in the UK I work for [Hornbill](https://www.hornbill.com) as a web dev working primarily on our Service Manager app.  I'm usually found knee deep in Service Level management and currently loving using [CypressIO](https://www.cypress.io) for testing.

### Car and Motorsport Addict

If it involves cars or motorsport I'll either be watching it on TV or be at the event.

### Raiders Fan

Yes I know.. I continue to wait for the rebuild to be complete :) .
